# eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlighting-chroma

**WIP WIP WIP WIP WIP WIP**

A module for handling syntax highlighting in [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) using [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma); a syntax highlighter written in Go. There is no browser/client JavaScript required, the highlight transformations are all done at build-time.

I am making using of the [chroma-highlight](https://github.com/krymel/chroma-highlight) NPM package to include `Chroma` support. (It handles downloading the required binary for the platform you are working on).

This module/plugin took the 11ty plugin [eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight) as the basis.

## Supported args in code blocks

The first argument is always expected to be the language, at present there is no bugout/fail if a language is not provided first. (Nor in the original plugin)

For Markdown, separate arguments with a `/`, this seems to be hard coded somewhere and I haven't a workaround yet. For `liquid` and `njk` use spaces (` `) to separate arguments.

Arguments:

- `lineNumbers` will add line numbers starting from 1 for each code block.
- `lineNumbersStyle` if `table` is used, then code block will use a table to make it easier to drag and select the code. i.e `lineNumberStyle=table`
- `lineNumbersStart` the number to start the line number count from. i.e `lineNumbersStart=200`
- number **or** number, number **or** number,rangeStartNumber-rangeEndNumber **or** number,rangeStartNumber-rangeEndNumber to specify a line or lines to highlight. i.e `1`, or `1,3`, or `3:6`, or `1,3:6`, or `2,4-6`. **NOTE** if you specify `lineNumbersStart` then the specified numbers must be relative to that (so `lineNumbersStart=200`, then use `204` to highlight line 204)

## Supported `options` in eleventy config

You can specify some arguments in the options object in `.eleventy.js` config. ~~Options are considered defaults, and can be overriden by codeblock arguments.~~**TODO**

Example of `options` object

```
options
{
  theme: 'onedark',
  lineNumbers: false,
}
```

Theme can be set to one of these [themes](https://xyproto.github.io/splash/docs/all.html). If no theme is specified, then `xcode-dark` is used.

- `lineNumbers` will add line numbers starting from 1 for each code block.
- `lineNumbersStyle` if `table` is used, then code block will use a table to make it easier to drag and select the code.

## TO DO

- [âœ…] Support `.liquid` files
- [] Add passed in `code` and `pre` atributes into returned html from chroma
- [] Add testing
- [] Add improve regex for line numbers
- [] Add other arguments that chroma can take (`--html-tab-width`, `--html-highlight-style`, maybe `--html-linkable-lines`)

## Example output

Highlight line 1 and 3

````
```js/1,3
let multilineString = `
  this is the first line
  this is the middle line
  this is the last line
`;
```
````

`;
```
